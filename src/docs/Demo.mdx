# HiveMQ UI Shell üêö

The HiveMQ UI Shell is a template that frames the content of a page.
It provides the most basic elements required to build a HiveMQ Application,
such as the header, sidebar navigation, and overlays.

## Installation

The HiveMQ UI Shell is available as an npm package in the GitHub Package Registry.
For that you need to generate a personal access token with the `read:packages` scope.
See [Authenticating to GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages) for more information.

Set the token and scope in your local or project `.npmrc` file:

```bash
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=ghp_EXAMPLETOKENABC123
@hivemq:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

Then you can install the package with the following command:

```bash
npm install @hivemq/ui-shell
```
